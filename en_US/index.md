Pika is a phase-field micro-structure model for dry snow that was developed using the [MOOSE](https://www.mooseframework.org) framework at the [Idaho National Laboratory](https://www.inl.gov) following the work of [Kaempfer and Plapp (2009)](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.031502). It is a fully-coupled 3D finite element, phase field model capable of tracking the phase transition and capturing the heat and mass transfer at the micro-structure scale in the ice matrix and pore space.
